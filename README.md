# try_git
This git repo is primarily used for learning of git control. 

I propose the best way to learn git is simply trying every single git command listed in [cheet sheet](https://github.com/Xiangs18/try_git/blob/master/github-git-cheat-sheet.pdf) so that you know what's going on when doing large scale project

I personally found this [website](https://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/) really helpful for beginners. Hope it help:)
